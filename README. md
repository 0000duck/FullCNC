# 4-Axis Foam Cutter Controller

The controller consists of two parts. 
First, the Arduino Uno firmware, controlling stepper motors based on USB/COM port inputs.
Second, desktop GUI, providing a workspace and high level abstraction of the controlled machine.

An old version of the machine in action can be seen on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XLH2SpPt3U)

## Screenshots
In this section some of the interesting GUI features are presented.
